After conducting research on the story concept for Seven Halos, the premise combines elements of sci-fi, fantasy, and comedy in a unique and engaging way. The story follows a gay man who stumbles upon a techy-looking halo on Halloween night in the New York subway, unknowingly getting involved in a galactic war between 6 other angels fighting for control of the universe. The angel who collects all 7 halos will have the power to reshape the universe in their image. This concept resembles a mix of Lord of The Rings and Scott Pilgrim vs The World, with the halo itself possessing a sentient personality akin to Sauron's ring or the sorting hat. The potential for character development, plot twists, and humor in this story is immense, making it a promising and exciting project to explore further.
